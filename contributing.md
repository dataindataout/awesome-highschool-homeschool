# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome of any curriculum resources you've used to homeschool high school. They do not necessarily need to be free resources, but the focus should be on sites or resources that are generally open. A preference is to link books to their original author or publisher sites, or smaller bookstores, rather than major online vendors. Resources do not have to be 100% secular, but there is a preference that this list remain generally secular.
