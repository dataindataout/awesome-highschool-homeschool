# Awesome High School Homeschool

High school is the _best_ time to homeschool. And just because your learner has moved into high school doesn't mean you have to do seated lectures from textbooks. While college-bound students will likely want 4 years of the core literature, math, history, science, and world languages courses, homeschoolers have flexibility to define the particular courses within those cores. There are a huge variety of resources available to homeschoolers, with no gatekeeping of accelerated coursework.
